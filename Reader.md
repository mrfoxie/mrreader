# Beginning

There was a small town where everyone lives happily and help each other when they need any help, not also that the town is fill with different kind of beautiful birds. Well I love the sound of birds in the early morning but their is a problem with everyone even with you that you can't sleep too late in the morning. I can understand the feeling when we can't sleep late in the morning we all have that one alarm which no one can predict that when is the alarm going to ring and make us wake. This must have happened with you too, say for example your having your favourite dream and a shout come "WAKE UP YOU IDIOT THE SUN IS ON YOUR HEAD" this sound may be of your Mom or your Wife `(-_-)`.
